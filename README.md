## Project Hush

What is Project Hush? Its my lame attempt of coming up with a name for a chat app project. With that aside, the goal of this project is to create an app with one chat group. This means that all user chat with one another :call_me_hand:

## Tech Stack

The tech used is simple.

#### Frontend

For the front-end its going to be Flutter. Couple of reason for this is because of supporting both ios and android and the easy widget design.

#### Backend

Back-end is going to be a Node.js app with typescript and will use socket.io. Why this? Cause JS :man_shrugging:

#### Database

Yea no database, dont want to hold user data :smile:

## Getting Started

#### Frontend

Download and install Flutter. Here's a link to help with that: [Getting Started With Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

#### Backend

Recommend downloading Node version 16. Use NVM to manage your node versions. Here are some helpful links to get started.

If you are on mac just use [home brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/) and install NVM

For Windows go here for [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Use that to install Node

## Contributing

Couple of things on how you can contribute and add on to this project.

- Main branch is always protected
- Test branch is used to push your code into and test with what is main

  - Test branch will get wiped weekly and re-created by main

- When working on a feature

  - Create a new branch from main
  - Name the branch based on what you are working on
  - When completed, merge your feature branch into the Test branch for all testing
